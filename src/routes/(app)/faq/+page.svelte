                    <p>
                        PocketBase was created to assist in building self-contained applications that can run
                        on a single server without requiring you to install anything in addition (<em
                            >see <a
                                href="https://github.com/presentator/presentator/issues/183"

                                Presentator#183
                            </a></em
                        >).
                        <br />
                        The basic idea is that the common functionality like crud, auth, files upload, auto TLS,
                        etc. are handled out of the box, allowing you to focus on the UI and your actual app business
                        requirements.

                        Please note that PocketBase is neither a startup, nor a business. There is no paid
                        team or company behind it. It is a personal open source project with intentionally
                        limited scope and developed entirely on a volunteer basis. There are no promises for
                        maintenance and support beyond what is already available (<em

            <h5>1. Do you offer hosting?</h5>
            <p>
                No. PocketBase is self-hosted only. If you are looking for free options for small PoC and

                For a more traditional setup you can use any VPS provider that comes with persistent storage,
                like:

                <a href="https://upcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UpCloud</a>,
                <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linode</a>, etc.
                <br />
                The
                <a href="/docs/going-to-production/">Going to production</a> guide contains information on how
                to deploy your PocketBase app and some config recommendations.
            </p>

            <h5>2. Does it scale?</h5>
            <p>
                Only on a single server, aka. vertical. Most of the time, you may not need the complexity of
                managing a fleet of machines and services just to run your backend.
                <br />
                <strong>PocketBase could be a great choice for small and midsize applications</strong>
                - SaaS, mobile api backend, intranet, etc.
                <br />
                Even without optimizations, PocketBase can easily serve 10 000+ persistent realtime connections
                on a cheap $4 Hetzner CAX11 VPS (2vCPU, 4GB RAM).
                <br />
                You can find performance tests for various read&write operations in the official
                <a href={import.meta.env.PB_BENCHMARKS_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                    benchmarks repo
                </a>
                .<br />
                There is still room for improvements (<em>I haven't done extensive profiling yet</em>), but
                the current performance is already good enough for the type of applications PocketBase is
                intended for.
            </p>

            <h5>3. How to run custom code?</h5>
            <p>
                PocketBase differs from the other similar backend solutions like Firebase, Supabase, Nhost,
                etc. and doesn't support running cloud functions.
                <br />
                <strong>
                    Instead, PocketBase could be used as a Go or JS framework that enables you to build your
                    own custom app specific business logic and still have a portable backend at the end
                </strong>
                (check <a href="/docs/use-as-framework">Use as framework</a> guide).
            </p>

            <h5>4. Does it support Google or Facebook login?</h5>
            <p>
                Yes, currently there is support for more than 15+ OAuth2 providers - Apple, Google, Facebook,
                Microsoft, VK, GitHub, GitLab, and many more.
            </p>

            <h5>5. Does it come with frontend UI for user login, register, etc. screens?</h5>
            <p>
                No. PocketBase provides only SDKs for client-side integration and you are free to implement
                your own frontend.
                <br />
                For convenience, there are default user facing pages for the user email confirmation links (password
                reset, verification, etc.) but you can also set your own by updating the urls in the email template
                collection settings.
            </p>

            <h5>6. Can I use database X?</h5>
            <p>
                No, at least not out of the box. PocketBase uses embedded SQLite (in WAL mode) and there are
                no plans for supporting other databases.
                <br />
                <strong>
                    For the majority of the queries SQLite (in WAL mode) outperforms traditional databases
                    like MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL (especially for read operations).
                </strong>
                <br />
                If you need replication and disaster recovery, a great companion app could be

            </p>

            <h5>7. How to import/export my data in/from PocketBase?</h5>
            <p>
                We don't have builtin data import/export helpers at the moment but you can explore some of the
                suggestions mentioned in
                <a

            </p>

            <h5>8. Can I donate?</h5>
            <p>
                No. In the past donations were welcomed (I'm very grateful for everyone who contributed) but
                financial contributions from individuals usually comes with some "unspoken expectations" and
                to avoid the mental burden and the sense of feeling guilty when not working on the
                contributor's feature request, I've decided to stop accepting donations for PocketBase.
                <br />

                development financially, feel free to reach out to
