<HeadingLink title="API rules" />
<p>
    <strong>API Rules</strong> are your collection access controls and data filters.
</p>
<p>
    Each collection has <strong>5 rules</strong>, corresponding to the specific API action:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>listRule</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>viewRule</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>createRule</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>updateRule</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>deleteRule</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Auth collections have an additional <code>options.manageRule</code> used to allow one user (it could be even
    from a different collection) to be able to fully manage the data of another user (ex. changing their email,
    password, etc.).
</p>

<p>Each rule could be set to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>"locked"</strong> - aka. <code>null</code>, which means that the action could be performed
        only by an authorized superuser
        <!--  -->
        (<strong>this is the default</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Empty string</strong> - anyone will be able to perform the action (superusers, authorized users
        and guests)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-empty string</strong> - only users (authorized or not) that satisfy the rule filter expression
        will be able to perform this action
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <div class="icon">
        <i class="ri-information-line" />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            <strong>PocketBase API Rules act also as records filter!</strong>
            <br />
            Or in other words, you could for example allow listing only the "active" records of your collection,
            by using a simple filter expression such as:
            <code>status = "active"</code>
            (where "status" is a field defined in your Collection).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of the above, the API will return 200 empty items response in case a request doesn't
            satisfy a <code>listRule</code>, 400 for unsatisfied <code>createRule</code> and 404 for
            unsatisfied <code>viewRule</code>, <code>updateRule</code> and <code>deleteRule</code>.
            <br />
            All rules will return 403 in case they were "locked" (aka. superuser only) and the request client is
            not a superuser.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API Rules are ignored when the action is performed by an authorized superuser (<strong
                >superusers can access everything</strong
            >)!
        </p>

<p>
    There is autocomplete to help guide you while typing the rule filter expression, but in general you have
    access to <strong>3 groups of fields</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Your Collection schema fields</strong>
        <br />
        This includes all nested relation fields too, ex.
        <code>someRelField.status != "pending"</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code><strong>@request.*</strong></code>
        <br />
        Used to access the current request data, such as query parameters, body/form fields, authorized user state,
        etc.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>@request.context</code> - the context where the rule is used (ex.
                <code>@request.context != "oauth2"</code>)
                <br />
                <small class="txt-hint">
                    The currently supported context values are
                    <code>default</code>,
                    <code>oauth2</code>,
                    <code>otp</code>,
                    <code>password</code>,
                    <code>realtime</code>,
                    <code>protectedFile</code>.
                </small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>@request.method</code> - the HTTP request method (ex.
                <code>@request.method = "GET"</code>)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>@request.headers.*</code> - the request headers as string values (ex.
                <code>@request.headers.x_token = "test"</code>)
                <br />
                <small class="txt-hint">
                    Note: All header keys are normalized to lowercase and "-" is replaced with "_" (for
                    example "X-Token" is "x_token").
                </small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>@request.query.*</code> - the request query parameters as string values (ex.
                <code>@request.query.page = "1"</code>)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>@request.auth.*</code> - the current authenticated model (ex.
                <code>@request.auth.id != ""</code>)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>@request.body.*</code> - the submitted body parameters (ex.
                <code>@request.body.title != ""</code>)
                <br />
                <small class="txt-hint">
                    Note: Uploaded files are not part of the <code class="txt-sm">@request.body</code>

                </small>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code><strong>@collection.*</strong></code>
        <p>
            This filter could be used to target other collections that are not directly related to the current
            one (aka. there is no relation field pointing to it) but both shares a common field value, like
            for example a category id:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            content={`
                @collection.news.categoryId ?= categoryId && @collection.news.author ?= @request.auth.id
            `}
        />
        <p>
            In case you want to join the same collection multiple times but based on different criteria, you
            can define an alias by appending <code>:alias</code> suffix to the collection name.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            content={`

<HeadingLink title="@ macros" tag="h5" />
<p>The following datetime macros are available and can be used as part of the filter expression:</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    language="html"
    content={`
        // all macros are UTC based
        @now        - the current datetime as string
        @second     - @now second number (0-59)
        @minute     - @now minute number (0-59)
        @hour       - @now hour number (0-23)
        @weekday    - @now weekday number (0-6)
        @day        - @now day number
        @month      - @now month number

        @yesterday  - the yesterday datetime relative to @now as string
        @tomorrow   - the tomorrow datetime relative to @now as string
        @todayStart - beginning of the current day as datetime string
        @todayEnd   - end of the current day as datetime string
        @monthStart - beginning of the current month as datetime string

        @yearStart  - beginning of the current year as datetime string
        @yearEnd    - end of the current year as datetime string
    `}
/>
<p>For example:</p>
<CodeBlock content={`@request.body.publicDate >= @now`} />

<HeadingLink title=":isset modifier" tag="h5" />
<p>
    The <code>:isset</code> field modifier is available only for the <code>@request.*</code> fields and can be
    used to check whether the client submitted a specific data with the request. Here is for example a rule that
    disallows changing a "role" field:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    content={`
        @request.body.role:isset = false
    `}
/>
<p>
    <small class="txt-hint">
        Note that <code class="txt-sm">@request.body.*:isset</code> at the moment doesn't support checking for
        newly uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (<em
            >this behavior may change in the future</em
        >).
    </small>
</p>

<HeadingLink title=":length modifier" tag="h5" />
<p>
    The <code>:length</code> field modifier could be used to check the number of items in an array field
    (multiple <code>file</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>relation</code>).
    <br />
    Could be used with both the collection schema fields and the <code>@request.body.*</code> fields. For example:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    content={`
        // check example submitted data: {"someSelectField": ["val1", "val2"]}
        @request.body.someSelectField:length > 1

        // check existing record field length
        someRelationField:length = 2
    `}
/>
<p>
    <small class="txt-hint">
        Note that <code class="txt-sm">@request.body.*:length</code> at the moment doesn't support checking
        for newly uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (<em
            >this behavior may change in the future</em
        >).
    </small>
</p>

<HeadingLink title=":each modifier" tag="h5" />
<p>
    The <code>:each</code> field modifier works only with multiple <code>select</code>, <code>file</code> and
    <code>relation</code>
    type fields. It could be used to apply a condition on each item from the field array. For example:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    content={`
        // check if all submitted select options contain the "create" text
        @request.body.someSelectField:each ~ "create"

        // check if all existing someSelectField has "pb_" prefix
        someSelectField:each ~ "pb_%"
    `}
/>
<p>
    <small class="txt-hint">
        Note that <code class="txt-sm">@request.body.*:each</code> at the moment doesn't support checking for
        newly uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized (<em
            >this behavior may change in the future</em
        >).
    </small>
</p>

<HeadingLink title=":lower modifier" tag="h5" />
<p>
    The <code>:lower</code> field modifier could be used to perform lower-case string comparisons. For example:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    content={`
        // check if the submitted lower-cased body "title" field is equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
        @request.body.title:lower = "test"

        // match existing records with lower-cased "title" equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
        title:lower ~ "test"
    `}
/>
<p>
    <small class="txt-hint">
        Under the hood it uses the
        <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#lower" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            SQLite <code>LOWER</code> scalar function
        </a>
        and by default works only for ASCII characters, unless the ICU extension is loaded.
    </small>
</p>

<HeadingLink title="geoDistance(lonA, latA, lonB, latB)" tag="h5" />
<p>
    The <code>geoDistance(lonA, latA, lonB, latB)</code> function could be used to calculate the Haversine distance
    between 2 geographic points in kilometres.
</p>
<p>
    The function is intended to be used primarily with the <code>geoPoint</code> field type, but the accepted
    arguments could be any plain number or collection field identifier. If the identifier cannot be resolved
    and converted to a numeric value, it resolves to <code>null</code>. Note that the
    <code>geoDistance</code> function always results in a single row/record value meaning that "any/at-least-one-of"
    type of constraint will be applied even if some of its arguments originate from a multiple relation field.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<CodeBlock
    class="m-b-0"
    content={`
        // offices that are less than 25km from my location (address is a geoPoint field in the offices collection)
        geoDistance(address.lon, address.lat, 23.32, 42.69) < 25
    `}
/>
