    One of the best PocketBase features is that it's completely portable. This means that it doesn't require
    any external dependency and
    <strong>could be deployed by just uploading the executable on your server</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example of starting a production HTTPS server (auto managed TLS with Let's Encrypt) on a clean
    Ubuntu 22.04 installation.
</p>
<ol>
    <li value="0">
        <p>Consider the following app directory structure:</p>
        <CodeBlock
            language="html"
            content={`
                myapp/

                    pocketbase
            `}
        />
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Upload the binary and anything else required by your application to your remote server, for
            example using
            <strong>rsync</strong>:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            content={`
                rsync -avz -e ssh /local/path/to/myapp root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/pb

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Start a SSH session with your server:</p>
        <CodeBlock
            content={`
                ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
            `}
        />
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Start the executable (specifying a domain name will issue a Let's encrypt certificate for it)</p>
        <CodeBlock
            content={`
              [root@dev ~]$ /root/pb/pocketbase serve yourdomain.com

            <p>
                Notice that in the above example we are logged in as <strong>root</strong> which allows us to
                bind to the
                <strong>privileged 80 and 443 ports</strong>.
                <br />
                For <strong>non-root</strong> users usually you'll need special privileges to be able to do
                that. You have several options depending on your OS - <code>authbind</code>,
                <code>setcap</code>,
                <code>iptables</code>, <code>sysctl</code>, etc. Here is an example using <code>setcap</code>:

        <p>(Optional) Systemd service</p>
        <p>
            You can skip step 3 and create a <strong>Systemd service</strong>
            to allow your application to start/restart on its own.
            <br />
            Here is an example service file (usually created in
            <code>/lib/systemd/system/pocketbase.service</code>):
        </p>

<HeadingLink title="Using reverse proxy" tag="h5" />
<p>
    If you plan on hosting multiple applications on a single server or need finer network controls, you can
    always put PocketBase behind a reverse proxy such as
    <em>NGINX</em>, <em>Apache</em>, <em>Caddy</em>, etc.
    <br />
    <em>
        Just note that when using a reverse proxy you may need to set up the "User IP proxy headers" in the
        PocketBase settings so that the application can extract and log the actual visitor/client IP (the
        headers are usually <code>X-Real-IP</code>, <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Here is a minimal <em>NGINX</em> example configuration:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    language="html"
    content={`
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

            # check http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#keepalive
            proxy_set_header Connection '';
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_read_timeout 360s;

            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090;
        }
    }
    `}
/>
<p>
    Corresponding <em>Caddy</em> configuration is:
</p>
<CodeBlock
    language="html"
    content={`
    example.com {
        request_body {
            max_size 10MB

<HeadingLink title="Using Docker" tag="h5" />
<p>
    Some hosts (e.g. <a href="https://fly.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly.io</a>) use Docker
    for deployments. PocketBase doesn't have an official Docker image, but you could use the below minimal
    Dockerfile as an example:

<HeadingLink title="Backup and Restore" />
<p>
    To backup/restore your application it is enough to manually copy/replace your <code>pb_data</code>
    directory
    <em>(for transactional safety make sure that the application is not running)</em>.
</p>
<p>
    To make things slightly easier, PocketBase v0.16+ comes with builtin backups and restore APIs that could
    be accessed from the Dashboard (
    <em>Settings</em>
    {`>`} <em>Backups</em>
    ):
</p>
<img src="/images/screenshots/backups.png" alt="Backups settings screenshot" class="screenshot m-b-xs" />
<p>
    Backups can be stored locally (default) or in a S3 compatible storage (<em
        >it is recommended to use a separate bucket only for the backups</em
    >). The generated backup represents a full snapshot as ZIP archive of your <code>pb_data</code> directory (including
    the locally stored uploaded files but excluding any local backups or files uploaded to S3).
</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning m-b-xs">
    <div class="icon">
        <i class="ri-error-warning-line" />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="txt-bold">
            During the backup's ZIP generation the application will be temporary set in read-only mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the size of your <code>pb_data</code> this could be a very slow operation and it is
            advised in case of large <code>pb_data</code> (e.g. 2GB+) to consider a different backup strategy

    <span class="label label-primary">highly recommended</span>
    <HeadingLink title="Use SMTP mail server" tag="h5" />
</header>
<p>
    By default, PocketBase uses the internal Unix <code>sendmail</code> command for sending emails.
    <br />
    While it's OK for development, it's not very useful for production, because your emails most likely will get
    marked as spam or even fail to deliver.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid deliverability issues, consider using a local SMTP server or an external mail service like
    <a href="https://www.mailersend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MailerSend</a>,
    <a href="https://www.brevo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brevo</a>,

    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS SES</a>, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've decided on a mail service, you could configure the PocketBase SMTP settings from the
    <em>
        {`Dashboard > Settings > Mail settings`}
    </em>:
</p>

    <HeadingLink title="Enable MFA for superusers" tag="h5" />
</header>
<p>
    As an additional layer of security you can enable the MFA and OTP options for the <code>_superusers</code>
    collection, which will enforce an additional one-time password (email code) requirement when authenticating
    as superuser.
</p>
<p>
    In case of email deliverability issues, you can also generate an OTP manually using the
    <code>./pocketbase superuser otp yoursuperuser@example.com</code> command.

    <HeadingLink title="Enable rate limiter" tag="h5" />
</header>
<p>
    To minimize the risk of API abuse (e.g. excessive auth or record create requests) it is recommended to set
    up a rate limiter.
</p>
<p>
    PocketBase v0.23.0+ comes with a simple builtin rate limiter that should cover most of the cases but you
    are also free to use any external one via reverse proxy if you need more advanced options.
</p>
<p>
    You can configure the builtin rate limiter from the
    <em>

    <HeadingLink title="Increase the open file descriptors limit" tag="h5" />
</header>
<p class="txt-hint txt-bold">
    The below instructions are for Linux but other operating systems have similar mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    Unix uses <em>"file descriptors"</em> also for network connections and most systems have a default limit
    of ~ 1024.
    <br />
    If your application has a lot of concurrent realtime connections, it is possible that at some point you would
    get an error such as: <code>Too many open files</code>.
</p>
<p>
    One way to mitigate this is to check your current account resource limits by running
    <code>ulimit -a</code> and find the parameter you want to change. For example, if you want to increase the
    open files limit (<em>-n</em>), you could run
    <code>ulimit -n 4096</code> before starting PocketBase.

    If you are running in a memory constrained environment, defining the
    <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#hdr-Environment_Variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code>
    </a>
    environment variable could help preventing out-of-memory (OOM) termination of your process. It is a "soft limit"
    meaning that the memory usage could still exceed it in some situations, but it instructs the GC to be more
    "aggressive" and run more often if needed. For example: <code>GOMEMLIMIT=512MiB</code>.
</p>
<p>
    If after <code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> you are still experiencing OOM errors, you can try to enable swap
    partitioning (if not already) or open a
    <a href={import.meta.env.PB_DISCUSSIONS_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&A discussion</a>

<p class="txt-bold txt-hint">It is fine to ignore the below if you are not sure whether you need it.</p>

    By default, PocketBase stores the applications settings in the database as plain JSON text, including the
    SMTP password and S3 storage credentials.
</p>
<p>
    While this is not a security issue on its own (PocketBase applications live entirely on a single server
    and it's expected that only authorized users have access to your server and application data), in some
    situations it may be a good idea to store the settings encrypted in case someone gets their hands on your
    database file (e.g. from an external stored backup).
</p>
<p>To store your PocketBase settings encrypted:</p>
