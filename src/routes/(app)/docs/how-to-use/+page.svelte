<p>
    The easiest way to use PocketBase is by interacting with its Web APIs directly from the client-side (e.g.
    mobile app or browser SPA).
</p>
<p>
    It was designed with this exact use case in mind and it is also the reason why there are general purpose
    JSON APIs for listing, pagination, sorting, filtering, etc.
</p>
<p>
    The access and filter controls for your data are usually done through the
    <a href="/docs/api-rules-and-filters/">collection API rules</a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    For the cases when you need more specialized handling (sending emails, intercepting the default actions,
    creating new routes, etc.) you can
    <a href="/docs/use-as-framework/">extend PocketBase with Go or JavaScript</a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    For interacting with the
    <a href="/docs/api-records/">Web APIs</a>
    you can make use of the official SDK clients:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href={import.meta.env.PB_JS_SDK_URL} class="txt-bold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
            JavaScript SDK
        </a>
        <span class="txt">(Browser, Node.js, React Native)</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href={import.meta.env.PB_DART_SDK_URL} class="txt-bold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
            Dart SDK
        </a>
        <span class="txt">(Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI)</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="txt-hint txt-sm">
    When used on the client-side, it is safe to have a single/global SDK instance for the entire lifecycle of
    your application.
</p>

        <p>
            Not everyone will agree with this, but if you are building a web app with PocketBase I recommend
            developing the frontend as a <strong>traditional client-side SPA</strong> and for the cases where additional
            server-side handling is needed (e.g. for payment webhooks, extra data server validations, etc.) you
            could try to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="/docs/use-as-framework">Use PocketBase as Go/JS framework</a> to create new routes or
                intercept existing ones.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Create one-off Node.js/Bun/Deno/etc. server-side actions that will interact with
                    PocketBase only as superuser and as pure data store (similar to traditional database
                    interactions but over HTTP). In this case it is safe to have a global superuser client
                    such as:
                </p>

                <CodeBlock
                    language="javascript"
                    content={`
                    // src/superuser.js
                    import PocketBase from "pocketbase"

                    const superuserClient = new PocketBase('https://example.com');

                    // disable autocancellation so that we can handle async requests from multiple users
                    superuserClient.autoCancellation(false);

                    // option 1: authenticate as superuser using email/password (could be filled with ENV params)
                    await superuserClient.collection('_superusers').authWithPassword(SUPERUSER_EMAIL, SUPERUSER_PASS, {
                      // This will trigger auto refresh or auto reauthentication in case
                      // the token has expired or is going to expire in the next 30 minutes.
                      autoRefreshThreshold: 30 * 60
                    })

                    // option 2: OR authenticate as superuser via long-lived "API key"
                    // (see https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#api-keys)
                    superuserClient.authStore.save('YOUR_GENERATED_SUPERUSER_TOKEN')

                    export default superuserClient;
                `}
                />
                <p>
                    Then you can directly import the file in your server-side actions and use the client as
                    usual:

    <Accordion single title="Why not JS SSR">
        <p>
            Using PocketBase with meta frameworks such as SvelteKit, Nuxt, Next.js, etc.
            <strong>in a JS SSR mode</strong>
            is possible but it comes with many complications and you need to carefully evaluate whether the cost
            of having another backend (PocketBase) alongside your existing one (the Node.js server) is worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can read more about the potential problems in
            <a

                JS SSR - issues and recommendations #5313
            </a> but some of the common pitfalls are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Security issues caused by incorrectly initialized and shared JS SDK instances in a
                long-running server-side context.
            </li>
            <li>
                OAuth2 integration difficulties related to the server-side only OAuth2 flow (or its mixed
                "all-in-one" client-side handling and sharing a cookie with the server-side).
            </li>
            <li>
                Proxying realtime connections and essentially duplicating the same thing PocketBase already
                does.
            </li>
            <li>
                Performance bottlenecks caused by the default single-threaded Node.js process and the
                excessive resources utilization due to the server-side rendering and heavy back-and-forth
                requests communication between the different layers ({`client<->Node.js<->PocketBase`}).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This doesn't mean that using PocketBase with JS SSR is always a "bad thing" but based on the
            dozens of reported issues so far I would recommend it only after careful evaluation and only to
            more experienced developers that have in-depth understanding of the used tools and their
            trade-offs. If you still want to use PocketBase to handle regular users authentication with a JS
            SSR meta framework, then you can find some JS SDK examples in the repo's

    <Accordion single title="Why not htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly, etc.">
        <p>
            htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly and other similar tools are commonly used for building server rendered
            applications but unfortunately they don't play well with the JSON APIs and fully stateless nature
            of PocketBase.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is possible to use them with PocketBase but at the moment I don't recommend it because we lack
            the necessary helpers and utilities for building SSR-first applications, which means that you
            might have to create from scratch a lot of things on your own such as middlewares for handling
            cookies (<em>and eventually also taking care of CORS and CSRF</em>) or custom authentication
            endpoints and access controls (<em
                >the collection API rules apply only for the builtin JSON routes</em
            >).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future we could eventually provide official SSR support in terms of guides and middlewares
            for this use case but again - PocketBase wasn't designed with this in mind and you may want to
            reevaluate the tech stack of your application and switch to a traditional client-side SPA as
            mentioned earlier or use a different backend solution that might fit better with your use case.

    <Accordion single title="Mobile apps auth persistence">
        <p>
            When building mobile apps with the JavaScript SDK or Dart SDK you'll have to specify a custom
            persistence store if you want to preserve the authentication between the various app activities
            and open/close state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SDKs come with a helper async storage implementation that allows you to hook any custom
            persistent layer (local file, SharedPreferences, key-value based database, etc.). Here is a
            minimal PocketBase SDKs initialization for React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart):

    <Accordion single title="React Native file upload on Android and iOS">
        <p>
            At the time of writing, React Native on Android and iOS seems to have a non-standard
            <code>FormData</code> implementation and for uploading files on these platforms it requires the following
            special object syntax:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
            class="m-0"
            language="javascript"

                }
            `}
        />
        <p>Or in other words, you may have to apply a conditional handling similar to:</p>
        <CodeBlock
            language="javascript"
            content={`
